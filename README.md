#This should get you Merry.

## SendGrid Techno Xmas Trees.

### DOLLA DOLLA BILLS, Y'ALL



Merry Arduino is the idea of flashing xmas lights to a sound track (We wish you a merry xmas)

Techno Tree is using standard LEDs, but you guys could change it super easy for strip-lighting leds (xmas lights).

They flash in  sequence, travelling up the tree.  #HUNDREDDOLLARBILLS


## Merry Arduino ->

In the area before setup() you can see three relays to the eight notes, so each one represents some number of the notes.  For example, pin 8 is the lowest note, and it is the "root" of the song, so it naturally deserves the largest light display.

Wired for a 3-relay version.
